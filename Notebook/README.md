# Input Information ðŸ“Š
You need to provide the paths of the folders containing images.

Three folders need to be addressed:
1. The known images which are the ones with available information about the identities. The identity needs to be defined as the images' names. *For instance, Name.jpg*
2. The path to the folder containing unknown images. There are the ones we want to predict the identity, using the previous dataset.
3. An **EMPTY** folder which will contain the faces detected in all the unknown images.
